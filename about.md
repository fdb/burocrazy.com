Burocrazy is a small design and consultancy firm in Antwerp.

I graduated in software engineering in 2000 and in graphic design in
2004 and have been employed at the St. Lucas School of Arts since.
Burocrazy allows me to have one foot in reality and the other foot in
the academic world.

I have a keen interest in generative art and rule-based graphic design.
To that end, I’m developing an application for creating generative art
and design using [Python][] programming code, called [NodeBox][]. With
it, you can create 2-dimensional visuals (static, animated and
interactive) that you can effortlessly export as a PDF document or
QuickTime movie. NodeBox is open-source, well-documented and has a
friendly community.

I try to use generative tools for tackling otherwise difficult or
impossible challenges, generating hundreds of pages, intricate designs,
and even as a brainstorming tool. This website shows you a few of these
designs. This not only makes the end result, but also the process,
intriguing.

I’m a strong believer in open source and free software. I publish most
of my own work as [open source][] or under the [Creative Commons][cc].

I blog at [enigmeta.com][].
