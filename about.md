---
Burocrazy is a small design firm with just two people: Tom and Frederik. We both work at St. Lucas School of Arts, and Burocrazy allows us to do have one foot in reality and the other foot in the academic world.

We have a keen interest in generative art and rule-based graphic design. To that end, we are developing an application for creating generative art and design using [Python][] programming code, called [NodeBox][]. With it, you can create 2-dimensional visuals (static, animated and interactive) that you can effortlessly export as a PDF document or QuickTime movie. NodeBox is open-source, well-documented and has a friendly community.

We try to use our generative tools for tackling otherwise difficult or impossible challenges, generating hundreds of page, intricate designs, and even brainstorming tools. This website shows you a few of these designs. This not only makes the end result, but also the process, intriguing.

We're strong believers in open source and free software. We publish most of our own work under the [Creative Commons][cc].
