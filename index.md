We're a small graphic and web design firm located in Antwerp, Belgium. We design using custom tools and modern web frameworks. We love to design as well as code, and carry out  academic research in the field of graphic design.  We love open source, open standards and open communication.

<h3>Our own tools</h3>

We created our own open source graphic design tool, called [NodeBox][], that we use to automate tedious production work. We also utilize it as a creative machine, helping us brainstorm and do research. NodeBox is free software, well-documented, and unlike anything else you've seen.

We organize workshops to teach students and professionals modern graphic design principles, and to solicit feedback on the software. Whether they take one afternoon or two entire weeks, the results are always intriguing.

<h3>Academic design research</h3>

The entire staff of Burocrazy (all two of us!) is working as researchers at St. Lucas School of Arts in Antwerp, Belgium, where we are developing the next wave of generative design tools. These machines can help brainstorm, come up with colors or shapes for any word, make compositions about recent news events, and analyze natural language to understand design briefings.
