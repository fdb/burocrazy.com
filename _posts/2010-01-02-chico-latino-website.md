Chico Latino is a non-governmental organization that aims to provide better education for children in Peru through a series of custom-made learning solutions. We built their website, focusing on an inviting design and easy maintenance. 

We had a lot of fun creating the design for the website. By tearing and scanning pieces of cardboard and Peruvian cloth we got the "bricolaged" look we were aiming for.

We knew we weren't always going to be around to change the content, structure or design of the website. This meant choosing for a system that was easy to use, deploy and maintain. We choose [Wordpress][] as a content management system because of its focus on open standards, big community and simple server requirements.
